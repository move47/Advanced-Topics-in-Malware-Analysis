# Goal: Design IDA Plugin for def-use of variables


## Running the code without plugin mode:
- **How to use**: Copy the code from `def_use_build.py` in the `File->Script Command` and press `run` button. The output of this python code can be seen in _Output Window_.
- **Other Details**: 
    - This code takes a `function name` as a parameter in FUNCTION_NAME variable. (Now it is set to `first_func_call` referring to main function)
    - The code currently takes the function name, however, eventually uses the function address to run. Moreover, the same code can be used as a subroutine in case of multiple functions.
    - The code also generates DOT file separately.

## Generating Graph from DOT File
```
import graphviz
dot = graphviz.Source.from_file('graph.dot') # graph.dot being the input source file
dot.view()
```
