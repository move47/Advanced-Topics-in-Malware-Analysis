Goal: Dynamic Contorl Flow Tracing

Instructions: 
(1) Build a MyPinTool that counts instructions in the greencat executable.

(3) Run the example MyPinTool on greencat in the Sandbox and send control commands to greencat found in [Lab #2](../Lab%20%232/)

(4) If steps 1 and 2 worked correctly, then you should extend MyPinTool to do the following: Trace the control flow of the executed instructions. To do so, your pintool will need to instrument the execution of every instruction. When each instruction is executed, your pintool will need to save what instruction preceded it. Do this tracing entirely in memory! Your pintool should only write to an output file in the Finish function (or ThreadFini). Constantly writing every instruction to the trace file will make your pintool unbearably slow!

(5) After the process that your pintool is tracing exits (i.e., in your pintool's Fini function), generate a DOT directed graph file representing the control flow of all the observed instructions. More information about DOT directed graph files can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)#Directed_graphs Links to an external site.. Each node in your DOT directed graph file should be the address of an instruction that was executed (only ONE node per instruction address). The edges in your DOT directed graph file should go from each executed instruction to the instructions which executed immediately after it.
