Goal: Data Dependence IDA Plugin

Instructions:

(1) Loop every instruction in every basic block in every function in your greencat-2 disassembly (from before). Compute the data dependence of each instruction. You can design any methods or data structures you wish to accomplish this.

(2) Generate a DOT directed graph file representing the data dependence of all the instructions in each function. Specifically, one DOT graph file per function --- name the file “<function address>.dot”. Each node in your DOT directed graph file should be the address of an instruction (only ONE node per instruction address). The edges in your DOT directed graph file should go from each instruction to any instructions which that instruction is data dependent on.
