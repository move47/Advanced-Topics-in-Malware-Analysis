# Goal - Static Malware Reverse Engineering

This laboratory exercise focused on the static analysis of a specific malware, named `webc2-greencat`. `webc2-greencat` is a standard 32-bit Portable Executable (PE) file, which is a common file format for executables, object code, and DLLs in Windows operating systems. Furthermore, it was dynamically linked, meaning that it was designed to work with shared libraries, allowing for more efficient use of system resources and easier updates to individual components, making it hard to disect simultaneously.
